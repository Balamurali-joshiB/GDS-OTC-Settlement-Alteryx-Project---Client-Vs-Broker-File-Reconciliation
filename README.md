# GDS-OTC-Settlement-Alteryx-Project---Client-Vs-Broker-File-Reconciliation
# Project Summary:
## This project involves a recurring weekly process for our external client, covering products such as NP (New Product) and MSTR (Multi Strategy Total Return). Our team is responsible for maintaining a running Excel tracker to monitor & track the client’s OTC settlement activities. The task focuses exclusively on reviewing and validating agreed and released payments for the week, pertaining to a single broker portfolio account.

# Problem Statement:
## This project focuses on the manual OTC derivatives settlement process executed weekly for external clients. The process is time-consuming and prone to human errors due to manual intervention. Additionally, there exists a potential data-security risk if incorrect account details are inadvertently included, as the settlement information is shared with the external counterparty’s (Broker) portfolio accounting team via email.
